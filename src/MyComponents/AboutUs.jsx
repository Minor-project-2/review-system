Restaurant lovers now tend to find their favorite cuisine through online restaurant review system as it is easier and fast. QSR Web found that digital restaurant ordering is growing 300 percent faster than dine-in traffic.

Every business can use social media to get information about potential customers, analyze sentiments and better relationship with customers. Today, a recommendation from friends via social media plays as a word of mouth in building trust while ordering online. Hence, Social media can be integrated to restaurant website  to ensure  customers about the Restaurant quality. New customers can choice their desired products by studying reviews made by other users.</p>
                    <p>The website will also help the management to manage the online feedback, review, category, specialty of the restaurant, location and view the status. The management can add menus with the system. </p>
                    <p>Online Website Reviews today have the power to connect the potential consumer directly with a restaurant even before he/she walks through the doors of a restaurant. Moreover, the popularity of online review websitesâ€™ have increased in recent years and thus more reviews has been created for a variety of products and services. </p>
                    <p>Online users can read and write restaurant reviews. In order to leave a review, users must rate any restaurant 1 to 5 stars, and the number of the average rating is presented</p>
